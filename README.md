# Audio

PulseAudio implementation for Vioneta Agro.

This container ship the upstream ALSA configs and base settings for Pulse.

## How it works

We have a central container they handle the ALSA settings and run on top a PulseAudio service. They service is expose to Vioneta Agro and Add-ons if they need audio support. This handling allow us to manage all central on one place and streamline the audio as a plaform.

The second benefit if that is give the control over the audio to the user. He can load and modify Pulse module and adjust his use case without need changes on Supervisor or Operating-System.

The Supervisor just manage the container and distribute updates and is responsible for management of this container.

## Troubleshooting

You can make troubleshooting with the Terminal Add-ons from Core or Community. The are 2 Layers for troubleshooting: The container and the PulseAudio server.

### Container

With Vioneta Agro cli util `ha` you can manage the container and there output:

| Command          | Description                                           |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| ha audio info    | Show all information they are available on Supervisor |
| ha audio reload  | Reload information from running Pulse server          |
| ha audio logs    | Show output of Pulse server.                          |
